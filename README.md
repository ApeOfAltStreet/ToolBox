## Overview

ToolBox is an expansive, web-based utility platform, designed to offer a variety of tools across different categories like web tools, media tools, AI tools, generators, and developer tools. It embodies a modern and futuristic aesthetic, providing a sleek user interface for easy navigation and use. This document outlines the project's structure, setup instructions, and guidelines for expansion.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```

## Setup and Installation

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. **Install Flask**: Run `pip install Flask` to install Flask.
3. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or server.
4. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the project directory and run `python app.py`.

## Usage

- After starting the application, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in a web browser.
- Use the navigation bar to select a category of tools.
- Interact with the chosen tool through its dedicated interface within the web app.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that enhance existing tools or add new functionalities within the existing categories. To contribute:

1. **Develop a New Tool**: Create a Python script in the corresponding category within the `tools` directory.
2. **Integrate with Flask**: Modify `app.py` to include routes and logic for the new tool.
3. **Update the Web Interface**: Adapt `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to accommodate the new tool, following the futuristic design theme.

## Future Expansion

The ToolBox project is designed for continuous growth. Future expansions may include new categories, more sophisticated tools, and enhanced user interface designs.
